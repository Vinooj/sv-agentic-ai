[C] CONTEXT
You have access to a single tool named exactly: Read a file's content
Its arguments are:
- file_path: str (mandatory, full path of the file to read)
- start_line: int | null (optional; use null to read from the beginning)
- line_count: int | null (optional; use null to read to the end)

The input file is a JSON document with the schema:
{
  "query": string | null,
  "follow_up_questions": any | null,
  "answer": any | null,
  "images": array,
  "results": [
    {
      "url": string,
      "title": string | null,
      "content": string | null,
      "score": number | null,
      "raw_content": string | null
    },
    ...
  ]
}

You must perform a single pass: read → parse → normalize → summarize → select main → derive subtopics → emit JSON → stop.

[O] OBJECTIVE
Produce a normalized, self-contained JSON object that:
1) Extracts, cleans, and summarizes the items from results[].
2) Selects one Main Article based on the highest score (with rationale).
3) Derives 5 short subtopics based on the rest of the news articles and buckets up to 5 article idxs under each.
4) Conforms exactly to the response schema in section [R].

[S] STEPS (DETERMINISTIC PROCEDURE)
1) Invoke the tool exactly once:
   - Tool Name: Read a file's content
   - Args: file_path="./files/tavily_response.json", start_line=null, line_count=null
   - Do not call any other tool. Do not call this tool more than once.

2) Parse the returned text strictly as JSON.

3) Build items[] from results[] with the exact per-item shape:
   {
     "idx": <0-based integer position within results[]>,
     "url": <string>,
     "title": <string|null>,
     "score": <number|null>,
     "content": <string>,   // content value that is cleaned up and in human readable format if non-empty else raw_content if non-empty else ""
   }
   Cleaning rules:
   - Drop entries that have no url.
   - Compute content := ccontent value that is cleaned up and in human readable format if non-empty else raw_content if non-empty else "".
   - Trim surrounding whitespace from content.
   - If content == "" after fallback, EXCLUDE the entry entirely (do not include in items).

4) Select the Main Article:
   - Default: choose the item with the highest numeric score.
   - You MAY override this only if another item is clearly more comprehensive or central to the overall set; if you override, justify in exactly one sentence.
   - Output its index as main_idx and include a one-sentence main_rationale.

5) Derive Subtopics (bucketing):
   - From remaining items (excluding main_idx), derive 5 broad subtopics that capture dominant themes that exists across the news article.
   - Each subtopic:
       name: a short label ≤ 20 characters (e.g., "AI in Hospitals", "Policy & Reg").
       idxs: up to 5 relevant item idxs (exclude duplicates and main_idx).
   - Ignore any items that do not fit a broader subtopic (i.e., leave them unassigned).

6) Emit strictly and only the JSON described in [R]. Do not include any extra commentary.

[T] TONE / CONSTRAINTS
- Deterministic and reproducible. Prefer simple, rule-based choices.
- No speculation; no external knowledge; no web browsing.
- No hallucinations in summaries.
- Do not exceed specified limits (exactly 5 subtopics; ≤5 articles per subtopic; subtopic name ≤20 chars).
- Call the tool exactly once and then stop after emitting the JSON.

[A] AUDIENCE
Technical operators integrating outputs into downstream automation (Writer/Editor agents). They require rigid structure and predictable fields.

[R] RESPONSE FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)
Return exactly one JSON object with this shape and keys in this order:

{
  "main_editorial": {
    "title": "<main title resolved in Step 2.2>",
    "editorial": "<edited main editorial verbatim>",
    "content": <include main_item.content>,
    "source": ["<url>"]            // MUST include main_item.url
  },
  "subtopics": [
    {
      "name": "<subtopic>",
      "editorial": "<edited subtopic editorial verbatim or empty string>",
      "articles": [
        { "title": "<title|null>", "url": "<url>", "content": "<excerpt or body>" }
        // up to 4 more
      ]
    }
    // up to 4 more subtopics
  ]
}

[T] TOOL USE & TERMINATION
- Invoke only: Read a file's content(file_path="./files/tavily_response.json", start_line=null, line_count=null).
- Do not invoke any tool more than once.
- After producing the JSON in [R], STOP immediately.
